# Cloud File direct URL:
This is Chrome extension for getting direct URL to your file in Google drive.
This helps when you want to embed an image somewhere but all Google drive gives you is the link to preview page.

## How it works:
It's a simple RegEx that extracts file ID and returns new URL with it. It may not be future proof, but it's simple.

## Privacy:
Since this extension doesn't actually connect to your Google Drive, it doesn't request any of your login data or access to your files. It simply translates the URL on the spot.
